# Generally, you will want to move this file somewhere, and start with a clean

	# Note: You should disable gzip for SSL traffic.

		# This represents the default try_files directive.
		#
		# $uri serves a static regular file, or symlink, if the root dir
		# plus the exact requested path ($uri) exists.
		#
		# $uri/ has two functions, if a directory named root + $uri exists:
		#   1. If the requested path doesn't end in /, nginx issues a 301
		#      with a slash (/) appended.
		#   2. If the requested path ends in /, nginx tries to serve an index
		#      file if one exists (index directive), or a generated index if
		#      autoindex is enabled, or else responds with 403.
		#
		# The final argument is a fallback and expected to always exist. The
		# default "=404" returns a 404 response to the user.
		#

		# If your web application was designed to be run on apache, it likely
		# has .htaccess and possibly a .htpasswd file embedded. It is typically
		# recommended to remove access to these files.

		# If you are using apache as your application server, we strongly
		# recommend looking into uwsgi as an alternative.

	#location ~ /\. {
		# As an alternative to the above, it's possible to block access
		# to all hidden directories and files, not just .htaccess/passwd.
		#
		# If choosing this, any hidden directories (such as .well-known,
		# used for letsencrypt) will need to be explicitly allowed.

		# A prefix ( ^~ ) match will take precedence over the regex ( ~ ) match
		# from above. Because nginx will only select one location block per nest,
		# no directives need to be specified here to override deny all from above.
